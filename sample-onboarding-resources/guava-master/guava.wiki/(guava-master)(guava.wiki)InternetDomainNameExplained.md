# InternetDomainName

## Introduction

[`InternetDomainName`] is a useful tool for parsing and manipulating domain
names. It can be used as a validator, a component extractor, and as a value type
for passing around domain names in a type-safe way.

However, there are some aspects of `InternetDomainName` behavior which may be
surprising, and which can lead to bugs in calling code. This document addresses
these concerns.

### Public suffixes and private domains

An `InternetDomainName` object is guaranteed to be syntactically valid according
to relevant RFC specifications, but it is **not** guaranteed to correspond to an
actual addressable domain on the Internet. It is impossible to do that without
doing a net lookup of the domain and trying to contact it, and that is
unacceptable overhead for most common cases.

Still, it is often very useful to determine whether a given domain name
**might** represent an actual domain on the Internet. For this purpose, we use
data from the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](http://publicsuffix.org/), a list
maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. There are methods on `InternetDomainName`
to determine the relationship of a given domain to the PSL. To put it in its
most basic terms, if `domain.hasPublicSuffix()` returns `true`, then the domain
**might** correspond to a real Internet address; otherwise, it almost certainly
does not.

At this point we need to back up and define some terms. There are four terms of
interest:

*   [Top-Level Domain (TLD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_level_domain): A
    single-label domain with no children, such as `com` or `au`.
*   Registry suffix: A domain, such as `com` or `co.uk`, controlled by a [domain
    name registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry) (e.g.
    [Verisign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.com) for `com`), under which
    people can register subdomains through a [domain name
    registrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar) (e.g.
    Namecheap). Such domain name registrations are legally protected by internet
    governing bodies like [ICANN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN).
*   [Public suffix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Suffix_List): This
    category is a superset of the registry suffixes, additionally including
    suffixes like `blogspot.com` that are not registry-controlled but allow the
    public to register subdomains. There are several common cases where it is
    more appropriate to categorize domains by public suffix rather than
    registry suffix. For example, one should never set cookies on a public
    suffix.
*   Effective Top-Level Domain: A deprecated synonym for "public suffix".

It's worth reading the linked articles carefully before proceeding.

A major source of confusion is that people say "TLD" when they mean either
"registry suffix" or "public suffix". All three of these are independent
concepts. So, for example,

*   `com` is all three: a TLD, a registry suffix, and a public suffix
*   `au` is a TLD, but not a registry suffix or public suffix
*   `com.au` is a registry suffix and public suffix, but not a TLD
*   `blogspot.com` is a public suffix, but neither a registry suffix nor a TLD
*   `squerf` is none of the three

This confusion is especially dangerous because TLD and registry suffix have
crisp, formal definitions, while public suffix does not. In the end, a public
suffix is something that a credible source has asked the PSL maintainers to add
to the list. Credible sources include ICANN and country-domain managers, but
also include private companies offering services that share the characteristics
that (fuzzily) define a public suffix -- independent subdomains and
[supercookie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#supercookie) suppression.
So, for example, many Google-owned domains (e.g. `blogspot.com`) are included in
the PSL.

Getting back to `InternetDomainName`, as long as we limit ourselves to using
`hasPublicSuffix()` to validate that the domain is a plausible Internet domain,
all is well. The danger arises from the methods that identify or extract the
"top private domain". From a technical point of view, the top private domain is
simply the rightmost superdomain preceding the public suffix. So for example,
`www.foo.co.uk` has a public suffix of `co.uk`, and a top private domain of
`foo.co.uk`.

As noted in the documentation on `isUnderPublicSuffix()`,
`isTopPrivateDomain()`, and `topPrivateDomain()`, the only thing these methods
are (mostly) reliable for is determining where one can set cookies. However,
what many people are actually trying to do is find the "real" domain, or the
"owner" domain, from a subdomain. For example, in `mail.google.com` they would
like to identify `google.com` as the owner domain. So they write

```java
InternetDomainName owner =
    InternetDomainName.from("mail.google.com").topPrivateDomain();
```

...and sure enough, `owner` ends up with the domain `google.com`. Indeed, this
idiom (and ones like it) work a great deal of the time. It seems intuitive that
"the domain under the public suffix" should be semantically equivalent to "the
owner domain".

But it's not, and therein lies the problem. Consider `blogspot.com`, which
appears in the PSL. While it has the characteristics of a public suffix --
people can register domains under it (for their blogs), and cookies should not
be allowed to be set on it (to prevent cross-blog cookie shenanigans), it is
itself an addressable domain on the Internet (which happens to redirect to
`blogger.com` at time of writing, but that could easily change).

So if one uses the idiom above on `foo.blogspot.com`, `owner` will be that same
domain, `foo.blogspot.com`. This is the right answer for cookie-setting any
[many common applications](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Public_Suffix_List/Uses),
but it is obviously surprising to many people.

For those rare applications where the goal is actually to determine the domain
name that was purchased from a registry, the correct abstraction is not public
suffix but registry suffix. If we alter the above code to use the parallel
methods for registry suffixes:

```java
InternetDomainName owner =
    InternetDomainName.from("foo.blogspot.com").topDomainUnderRegistrySuffix();
```

...then we end up with `owner` set to `blogspot.com`.

This handy table summarizes the differences between the various types of suffix:

`InternetDomainName` | `publicSuffix()` | `topPrivateDomain()` | `registrySuffix()` | `topDomainUnderRegistrySuffix()`
-------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------
`google.com`         | `com`            | `google.com`         | `com`              | `google.com`
`co.uk`              | `co.uk`          | N/A                  | `co.uk`            | N/A
`www.google.co.uk`   | `co.uk`          | `google.co.uk`       | `co.uk`            | `google.co.uk`
`foo.blogspot.com`   | `blogspot.com`   | `foo.blogspot.com`   | `com`              | `blogspot.com`
`google.invalid`     | N/A              | N/A                  | N/A                | N/A

The big lessons here are:

*   TLDs, registry suffixes, and public suffixes are not the same thing.
*   Public suffixes are defined by humans, for strictly limited purposes (mostly
    domain validation and supercookie prevention), and change unpredictably.
*   There is no defined mapping between the relationship of a given domain to a
    public suffix, the ability of that domain to respond to web requests, and
    the "ownership" of that domain.
*   The registry suffix can help you determine the "ownership" of a domain, in
    the sense of ICANN-style domain registrations; but this information is less
    suitable than the public suffix for most applications.
*   You can use `InternetDomainName` to determine whether a given string
    represents a plausibly addressable domain on the Internet, and to determine
    what portion of a domain is likely to allow cookies to be set.
*   You cannot use `InternetDomainName` to determine if a domain exists on the
    Internet as an addressable host.

Remember that if you do not heed this advice, your code will appear to work on a
huge variety of inputs...but the failure cases are all bugs just waiting to
happen, and the set of failure cases will change as PSL updates are incorporated
into the code underlying `InternetDomainName`.
