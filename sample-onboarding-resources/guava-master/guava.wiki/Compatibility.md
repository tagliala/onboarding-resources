# Compatibility

## Android

Starting with v21.0, Guava requires JDK 8. Starting with v22.0, Guava has an
Android flavor as well, which you can use by appending `-android` to the version
string when [building].

It's especially important when using Guava in Android applications to [use
ProGuard] to strip out the parts of Guava that aren't used. Guava is one of
the [most common][android-usage] dependencies for Android applications.

## Older JDKs

For the medium-term future, Guava users who need to target JDK 7 can use the
Android flavor, which has no Android-specific dependencies. At some point in the
future, when Android diverges sufficiently from JDK 7, Guava may stop providing
a JDK 7-compatible flavor, at which time those users will have to stay with the
latest prior version.

Guava users who need to target JDK 6 will have to stay on v20.0.

## GWT

Much of Guava is compatible with Google Web Toolkit (GWT), though we do not
currently optimize code specifically for GWT. Guava APIs compatible with GWT are
marked with the annotation `@GwtCompatible`.

## Backward compatibility

[Our README file][README] covers the basics: The only APIs we expect to remove
are [`@Beta` methods and classes][Beta].

## "Source-compatible since Guava release xx"

Sometimes we will add a more specific overload of an existing method. Code
compiled against the old version of Guava will still run against the new version
of Guava. Additionally, any code that compiles against the new version of Guava
will also compile against the old version of Guava. However, code compiled
against the new version of Guava might not _run_ against the old version because
it may compile against the new overload.

An example of this is [`MoreObjects.toStringHelper`], which originally
accepted an Object but which now has `String` and `Class` overloads, as well.
`Object.toStringHelper(anything)` compiles under any version of Guava, but if
the static type of `anything` is `String` or `Class`, a compile against a recent
Guava version will select a new overload.

## "Mostly source-compatible since Guava release xx"

As of this writing, there are two causes of this:

First, we sometimes change a `@Beta` interface to a class. Simple anonymous uses
like `new Foo() { ... }` will continue to compile, but named classes will not.
In neither case is the result binary compatible.

Second, we sometimes replace a `@Beta` method with a version that returns a more
specific type. In this case, code compiled against a version of Guava from
before the change might not run against a version of Guava from after the
change, and vice versa. However, code that compiles against the old version of
Guava will _almost_ always compile against the new version of Guava. (The
reverse is often true, too, when the code doesn't take advantage of the new
return type.)

However, there are rare exceptions. Consider this fictional case:

Guava release n:

```java
public static List<Integer> newList() { ... }
```

Guava release n + 1:

```java
public static ArrayList<Integer> newList() { ... }
```

Most callers will compile fine against either version:

```java
List<Integer> myList = newList();
```

Of course, if a caller uses the new, specific type, that code won't compile
against the old version:

```java
ArrayList<Integer> myList = newList();
```

The more interesting case, though, is code that compiles against the old version
but not the new version:

```java
Set<List<Integer>> myLists = ImmutableSet.of(newList());
```

Java's type inference isn't strong enough for `ImmutableSet.of()` to realize
that it should treat its input as a `List<Integer>` instead of an
`ArrayList<Integer>`, so the code must be rewritten:

```java
Set<ArrayList<Integer>> myLists = ImmutableSet.of(newList());
```

Or, to produce code that compiles against either version of Guava:

```java
Set<List<Integer>> myLists = ImmutableSet.<List<Integer>>of(newList());
```

Or, equivalently:

```java
List<Integer> myList = newList();
Set<List<Integer>> myLists = ImmutableSet.of(myList);
```
