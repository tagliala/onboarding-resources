[[Page Maintainers | Best Practices to Edit and Compile Pytorch Source Code On Windows]]:: @mszhanyi

## Goals
In this wiki, I'll introduce best practices to work with PyTorch C++ Source code on Windows. To some extent, developers could get the better experience with Visual Studio than on Linux.

## Prerequisites:
At first, We need to build the debug version libtorch On Windows. You can refer [building libtorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/docs/libtorch.rst) to build it. 

## Start Visual Studio correctly
Once the libtorch built, please copy the directory of the libiomp5md.dll and add it to the PATH.
![where libiomp5md.dll](images/bestpractices_win/libiomp5.png)<br>

If you're debugging on a GPU machine, nvToolsExt PATH should be added as well.<br>
For me, I use a bat to start Visual Studio
```
set PATH=D:\programs\envs\nightly\Library\bin\;"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NvToolsExt\bin\x64\";%PATH%
"D:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"
```

Another way is to start Visual Studio in the Conda Windows where libtorch is built

## Use VsChromium
As we know, for performance, PyTorch only officially support Ninja as the CMake generator. As the result, we could not manage and navigate Pytorch Source Code via Visual Studio Solutions/Projects. Luckily, there's a better option. 

[VsChromium](https://chromium.github.io/vs-chromium/) has been become a more general purpose extension that can be userful for any project. Its full text search engine is much more faster that search/replace in visual studio. 
For more details, please read through https://chromium.github.io/vs-chromium/.

Don't forget to add vs-chromium-project.txt into your PyTorch root directory.
For conveniently, you could copy mine directly.
```
[SourceExplorer.ignore]
.git/
third_party/
*.suo
*.csproj
*.vcxproj
[SearchableFiles.ignore]
build_libtorch/
*.pdb
*.exe
*.dll
[SearchableFiles.include]
*
```

## Example
In this section, I'll demo how to add one printf in test/cpp/api/nn_utils.cpp,  compile  and debug it.
1. Start Visual Studio Correctly
2. Open Project/Solution, select test_api.exe.
   ![open test_api.exe as solution](images/bestpractices_win/testapi.png)
3. Open Setup.py or any other source file, then it starts loading all source files right away. The Visul Studio should look like the below snapshot.
   ![load source code](images/bestpractices_win/vschromium.png)
4. Add one printf in test/cpp/api/nn_utils.cpp as below, and `run python ../tools/build_libtorch.py` to recompile.<br>
   Since increment build with Ninja for Pytorch has been supported on Windows.
   For such small change, It only takes about one minute to compile.<br>

5. Then, we could add a breakpoint and click *Start* to debug it.
   To save time, we could add a gtest_filter.

## One Reminder
You might find some changes you made doesn't work and after recompiling, the changes dismissed. That is because some PyTorch C++ code is generated in compile.
