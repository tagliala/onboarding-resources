# Supported Versions

- 5.3.x is the final feature branch of the 5th generation and the latest production line (GA as of October 2020), with long-term support provided on JDK 8, JDK 11, JDK 17.
- 5.2.x is the previous production line (GA as of September 2019), to be actively supported until the end of 2021.
- 5.1.x and 5.0.x are not actively supported anymore, superseded by 5.2.x and 5.3.x as of December 2020.
- _4.3.x reached its official EOL (end-of-life) on December 31st, 2020. No further maintenance and security patches are planned in that line._
- _3.2.x reached its official EOL (end-of-life) on December 31st, 2016. No further maintenance and security patches are planned in that line._

At this point, we recommend upgrading to the latest Spring Framework 5.3.x release from Maven Central.

# JDK Version Range

- Spring Framework 6.0.x: JDK 17-21 (expected)
- Spring Framework 5.3.x: JDK 8-19 (expected)
- Spring Framework 5.2.x: JDK 8-15
- Spring Framework 5.1.x: JDK 8-12
- Spring Framework 5.0.x: JDK 8-10
- Spring Framework 4.3.x: JDK 6-8

We fully test and support Spring on Long-Term Support (LTS) releases of the JDK, i.e. currently JDK 8, JDK 11 and JDK 17. Additionally, there is support for intermediate releases such as JDK 9/10/12/13/14/15/16/18 on a best-effort basis, meaning that we accept bug reports and will try to address them as far as technically possible but won't provide any service level guarantees.
