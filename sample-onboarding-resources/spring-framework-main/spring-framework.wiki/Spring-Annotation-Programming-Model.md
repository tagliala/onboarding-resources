# Overview

Over the years, the Spring Framework has continually evolved its support for
annotations, _meta-annotations_, and _composed annotations_. This document is
intended to aid developers (both end users of Spring as well as developers of
the Spring Framework and Spring portfolio projects) in the development and use
of annotations with Spring.

## Goals of this Document

The primary goals of this document include explanations of the following:

* How to use annotations with Spring.
* How to develop annotations for use with Spring.
* How Spring _finds_ annotations (i.e., how Spring's annotation search
  algorithms work).

## Non-goals of this Document

This document does not aim to explain the semantics or configuration options
for particular annotations in the Spring Framework. For details on a particular
annotation, developers are encouraged to consult the corresponding Javadoc or
applicable sections of the reference manual.

# Terminology

## Meta-Annotations

A _**meta-annotation**_ is an annotation that is declared on another
annotation. An annotation is therefore _meta-annotated_ if it is annotated with
another annotation. For example, any annotation that is declared to be
_documented_ is meta-annotated with `@Documented` from the
`java.lang.annotation` package.

## Stereotype Annotations

A _**stereotype annotation**_ is an annotation that is used to declare the
role that a component plays within the application. For example, the
`@Repository` annotation in the Spring Framework is a marker for any class
that fulfills the role or _stereotype_ of a repository (also known as
Data Access Object or DAO).

`@Component` is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
Any component annotated with `@Component` is a candidate for
component scanning. Similarly, any component annotated with an annotation
that is itself meta-annotated with `@Component` is also a candidate for
component scanning. For example, `@Service` is meta-annotated with
`@Component`.

Core Spring provides several stereotype annotations out of the box,
including but not limited to: `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`,
`@Controller`, `@RestController`, and `@Configuration`. `@Repository`,
`@Service`, etc. are specializations of `@Component`.

## Composed Annotations

A _**composed annotation**_ is an annotation that is _meta-annotated_ with one
or more annotations with the intent of combining the behavior associated with
those meta-annotations into a single custom annotation. For example, an
annotation named `@TransactionalService` that is meta-annotated with Spring's
`@Transactional` and `@Service` annotations is a composed annotation that
combines the semantics of `@Transactional` and `@Service`.
`@TransactionalService` is technically also a custom _stereotype annotation_.

## Annotation Presence

The terms _**directly present**_, _**indirectly present**_, and _**present**_
have the same meanings as defined in the class-level Javadoc for
`java.lang.reflect.AnnotatedElement` in Java 8.

In Spring, an annotation is considered to be _**meta-present**_ on an element
if the annotation is declared as a meta-annotation on some other annotation
which is _present_ on the element. For example, given the aforementioned
`@TransactionalService`, we would say that `@Transactional` is _meta-present_
on any class that is directly annotated with `@TransactionalService`.

## Attribute Aliases and Overrides

An _**attribute alias**_ is an alias from one annotation attribute to another
annotation attribute. Attributes within a set of aliases can be used
interchangeably and are treated as equivalent. Attribute aliases can be
categorized as follows.

1. **Explicit Aliases**: if two attributes in one annotation are declared as
   aliases for each other via `@AliasFor`, they are _explicit aliases_.
2. **Implicit Aliases**: if two or more attributes in one annotation are
   declared as explicit overrides for the same attribute in a meta-annotation
   via `@AliasFor`, they are _implicit aliases_.
3. **Transitive Implicit Aliases**: given two or more attributes in one
   annotation that are declared as explicit overrides for attributes in
   meta-annotations via `@AliasFor`, if the attributes _effectively_ override
   the same attribute in a meta-annotation following the
   [law of transitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation),
   they are _transitive implicit aliases_.

An _**attribute override**_ is an annotation attribute that _overrides_ (or
_shadows_) an annotation attribute in a meta-annotation. Attribute overrides
can be categorized as follows.

1. **Implicit Overrides**: given attribute `A` in annotation `@One` and
   attribute `A` in annotation `@Two`, if `@One` is meta-annotated with `@Two`,
   then attribute `A` in annotation `@One` is an _implicit override_ for
   attribute `A` in annotation `@Two` based solely on a naming convention (i.e.,
   both attributes are named `A`).
2. **Explicit Overrides**: if attribute `A` is declared as an alias for
   attribute `B` in a meta-annotation via `@AliasFor`, then `A` is an _explicit
   override_ for `B`.
3. **Transitive Explicit Overrides**: if attribute `A` in annotation `@One` is
   an explicit override for attribute `B` in annotation `@Two` and `B` is an
   explicit override for attribute `C` in annotation `@Three`, then `A` is a
   _transitive explicit override_ for `C` following the
   [law of transitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation).

# Examples

Many of the annotations within the Spring Framework and Spring portfolio
projects make use of the `@AliasFor` annotation for declaring _attribute
aliases_ and _attribute overrides_. Common examples include `@RequestMapping`,
`@GetMapping`, and `@PostMapping` from Spring MVC as well as annotations
such as `@SpringBootApplication` and `@SpringBootTest` from Spring Boot.

The following sections provide code snippets to demonstrate these features.

## Declaring attribute aliases with @AliasFor

Spring Framework 4.2 introduced first-class support for declaring and looking
up aliases for annotation attributes. The `@AliasFor` annotation can be used to
declare a pair of aliased attributes _within_ a single annotation or to declare
an alias from one attribute in a custom composed annotation to an attribute in
a meta-annotation.

For example, `@ContextConfiguration` from the `spring-test` module is
declared as follows. 

```java
public @interface ContextConfiguration {

    @AliasFor("locations")
    String[] value() default {};

    @AliasFor("value")
    String[] locations() default {};

    // ...
}
```

The `locations` attribute is declared as an alias for the `value`
attribute, and vice versa. Consequently, the following declarations
of `@ContextConfiguration` are equivalent.

```java
@ContextConfiguration("/test-config.xml")
public class MyTests { /* ... */ }
```

```java
@ContextConfiguration(value = "/test-config.xml")
public class MyTests { /* ... */ }
```

```java
@ContextConfiguration(locations = "/test-config.xml")
public class MyTests { /* ... */ }
```

Similarly, _composed annotations_ that override attributes from
meta-annotations can use `@AliasFor` for fine-grained control over exactly
which attributes are overridden within an annotation hierarchy. In fact, it is
even possible to declare an alias for the `value` attribute of a
meta-annotation.

For example, one can develop a composed annotation with a custom attribute
override as follows.

```java
@ContextConfiguration
public @interface MyTestConfig {

    @AliasFor(annotation = ContextConfiguration.class, attribute = "value")
    String[] xmlFiles();

    // ...
}
```

The above example demonstrates how developers can implement their own
custom _composed annotations_; whereas, the following demonstrates that
Spring itself makes use of this feature in many core Spring annotations.


```java
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Documented
@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
public @interface GetMapping {

	/**
	 * Alias for {@link RequestMapping#name}.
	 */
	@AliasFor(annotation = RequestMapping.class)
	String name() default "";

	/**
	 * Alias for {@link RequestMapping#value}.
	 */
	@AliasFor(annotation = RequestMapping.class)
	String[] value() default {};

	/**
	 * Alias for {@link RequestMapping#path}.
	 */
	@AliasFor(annotation = RequestMapping.class)
	String[] path() default {};

	// ...
}
```

## Spring Composed and Spring Polyglot

The [Spring Composed](https://github.com/sbrannen/spring-composed) project
is a collection of _composed annotations_ for use with the Spring Framework
4.2.1 and higher. There you will find annotations such as `@Get`, `@Post`,
`@Put`, and `@Delete` that served as the inspiration for the `@GetMapping`, 
`@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping` annotations that are
now part of Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.

Feel free to check out `spring-composed` for further examples and inspiration
for how you can implement your own custom _composed annotations_, and for a
bit of geek humor and entertainment that further demonstrate the power of
`@AliasFor`, take a look at
[Spring Polyglot](https://github.com/sbrannen/spring-polyglot).


# FAQ

## 1) Can `@AliasFor` be used with the `value` attributes for `@Component` and `@Qualifier`?

The short answer is: no.

The `value` attributes in `@Qualifier` and in _stereotype_ annotations (e.g., `@Component`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, and any custom stereotype annotations) _cannot_ be influenced by `@AliasFor`. The reason is that the special handling of these `value` attributes was in place years before `@AliasFor` was invented. Consequently, due to backward compatibility issues it is simply not possible to use `@AliasFor` with such `value` attributes.

# Topics yet to be Covered

* Document the general search algorithm(s) for annotations and meta-annotations on classes, interfaces, methods, fields, parameters, and annotations.
  * What happens if an annotation is _present_ on an element both locally and as a meta-annotation?
  * How does the presence of `@Inherited` on an annotation (including custom composed annotations) affect the search algorithm?
* Document support for annotation attribute aliases configured via `@AliasFor`.
  * What happens if an attribute _and_ its alias are declared in an annotation instance (with the same value or with different values)?
    * Typically an `AnnotationConfigurationException` will be thrown.
* Document support for _composed annotations_.
* Document support for meta-annotation attribute overrides in composed annotations.
  * Document the algorithm used when looking up attributes, specifically explaining:
    * implicit mapping based on naming convention (i.e., composed annotation declares an attribute with the exact same name and type as declared in the _overridden_ meta-annotation)
    * explicit mapping using `@AliasFor`
  * What happens if an attribute _and_ one of its aliases are declared somewhere within the annotation _hierarchy_? Which one takes precedence?
  * In general, how are conflicts involving annotation attributes resolved?
